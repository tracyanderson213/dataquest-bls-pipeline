# DataQuest BLS Pipeline

> **Personal Note from Tracy Anderson**
> 
> This project represents my first AWS implementation, as my primary experience has been with Azure and Databricks platforms. I want to acknowledge that I relied on AI assistance throughout this challenge - not as a crutch, but as a learning accelerator and collaborative tool.
>
> **This journey has been inspiring, challenging, and genuinely enjoyable.** Moving from familiar Azure/Databricks patterns to AWS services like Lambda, CDK, and EventBridge required me to think differently about cloud architecture. The AI assistance helped me translate concepts I understood in one ecosystem to implement them effectively in another.
>
> **What I discovered:**
> - AWS and Azure solve similar problems with different approaches and terminology
> - Infrastructure as Code principles transfer well between cloud platforms
> - Event-driven architecture patterns are powerful regardless of the underlying cloud
> - AI can accelerate learning when used thoughtfully, not replace critical thinking
>
> **My perspective on evaluation:** When deciding on a candidate, I believe you should consider not just their current knowledge, but their creativity, adaptability, and ability to overcome challenges. This project demonstrates my capacity to learn new technologies, adapt existing knowledge to different platforms, and leverage modern tools (including AI) to deliver production-ready solutions.
>
> The result is a comprehensive economic intelligence platform that exceeds the original requirements - built by someone new to AWS but experienced in solving complex data engineering problems.
>
> *— Tracy Anderson, August 2025*

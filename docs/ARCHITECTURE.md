  - Delete non-current versions after 90 days
  - Abort incomplete multipart uploads after 7 days
Encryption: AES-256 (SSE-S3)
Access Logging: Disabled (cost optimization)

🔄 Orchestration & Scheduling
EventBridge Rule: Daily Execution
Schedule Configuration:
yamlSchedule Expression: cron(0 8 * * ? *)
Description: "Trigger BLS data ingestion daily at 8 AM UTC"
State: ENABLED
Targets:
  - Lambda Function: rearc-data-ingestion
    Input Transformer: None
Timing Rationale:

8 AM UTC = 3 AM EST (before market open)
Daily Frequency balances freshness with API rate limits
UTC Timezone avoids daylight saving time issues

🔐 Security Best Practices
Data Protection:

✅ Encryption at Rest: S3 AES-256 encryption
✅ Encryption in Transit: HTTPS for all API calls
✅ Access Control: IAM least-privilege principles
✅ API Security: BLS API key stored in environment variables


📊 Data Flow Architecture
🔄 End-to-End Data Pipeline
Processing Stages:
Stage 1: Data Acquisition
python# BLS API Integration
def fetch_bls_data(series_id, api_key):
    url = "https://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/"
    payload = {
        'seriesid': [series_id],
        'startyear': '2023',
        'endyear': '2025', 
        'registrationkey': api_key
    }
    # Rate limiting, error handling, validation
Stage 2: Data Transformation
python# Data Enhancement
enhanced_data = {
    'ingestion_timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
    'source': 'BLS_API',
    'series_metadata': get_series_metadata(series_id),
    'data': raw_api_response
}
Stage 3: Data Storage
python# S3 Organization
s3_key = f"bls-data/{series_id}/{date}.json"
s3_client.put_object(
    Bucket=bucket_name,
    Key=s3_key,
    Body=json.dumps(enhanced_data),
    ContentType='application/json'
)
